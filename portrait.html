                <p>The way the photographer takes these photos are really good, like the color in the eyes the way Mr Putin was positioned in the photo. It's really unique on how Mr Putin is standing and the pose he is doing. </p>
                <p>The emotions shown in the image is the eyes, when you look into them its just like amazing eyes the way they attract your attention. Why? because the color light blue is like the sky which is really nice looking when you look up into the sky you sometimes see the same color as their eyes. How? Well I am different then others, other people react differently to each colors and the emotions they get from the photo.</p>
                <p>I would like to draw Platon, as his images strike me. The images they take are attention seeking with unique poses and designs when you see in the images. The inspiration I got is try different poses and color themes as they can change emotion and they way you look at things differently. I like the poses he makes them do, and how to look at the camera like more mean looks.</p>
